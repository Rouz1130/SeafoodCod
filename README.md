# Son of Cod
## Independent Project using .Net Core Authentication
#### Create a mock-up site. Use http://www.pacseafood.com/ as Sample Site

#### By _** Rouz Majlessi / Dec 2nd, 2016**_

## Specs
 * The site should be accessible to anonymous users, and to admins from the Son of Cod marketing team. 
 * As an admin, user should be able to register new admins who will have equal access to the admin features on the site.
 * Landing page/Marketing page
 
### 1. Tthe main page, where SeafoodCod wants their marketing team to post information about the company.
 * An anonymous user will see a static page with text, images and any other media you choose.
 * An admin will be able to edit every piece of text on the page, with separate forms. They should not need to re-enter information for forms they do not want to edit.
 
### 2. Newsletter page
 * The newsletter page will welcome visitors, and allow them to sign up for the company newsletter. 
 * The form for sign up will only need to collect an email address, but should include other optional information. (think about what kind of info a seafood company might want?)
 * An admin visiting this page will also have access to view the current mailing list. 
 * This list could appear on the page, on a new page, or in a modal, but it should not be visible to any anonymous users.
 
### 3. Overall styling 
 * The team wants to have a similar site to their biggest competition is Pacific Seafood.
 
### 4. Extra, if there's time left
 * User can browse the recipes
 * User can buy cans of food directly
 
### 5. Testing
- You'll need to meet two testing requirements before handing the site off to the marketing team.
1. Tests are present that verify that each route is successfully returning a view.
2. At least one test to verify that users email addresses are being successfully added to the mailing list.
  
### 6. fOther requirements
* It's important that you include images and styling across the site. You can use URLs (easiest) or pursue research and discover how to include images in your database (harder).
